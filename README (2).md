# Learnify — Online Learning Platform (capstone-akshit-lab5)

## Project theme
Online Learning Platform — a single-page static landing site showcasing course cards, filters, testimonials, pricing plans, and a contact form.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page (semantic HTML5 sections)
- `style.css` — all styling, responsive breakpoints, variables
- `images/` — placeholder images (add `course-1.jpg`, `course-2.jpg`, etc.)
- `README.md` — this file

## Features implemented
- Semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`.
- Responsive layout using Flexbox (header/footer) and CSS Grid (course grid, testimonials, pricing).
- Forms: Contact form with `label` and required fields.
- Filters UI (visual only) implemented as a form with selects.
- Hover effects, transitions, and one keyframe animation on the hero illustration.
- Accessibility: "Skip to main content" link, `aria-label` for navigation and contact info, alt text for images.

## Breakpoints
- Desktop: `>= 1024px` — multi-column grids, full layout.
- Tablet: `~768px - 1024px` — reduced columns (3 → 2), stacked header.
- Mobile: `<= 600px` — single-column layout, collapsed nav (simple hide for this static demo).
